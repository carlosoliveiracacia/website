About me
========
Hi! My name is Carlos Oliveira and this is my professional website. I am a Data Scientist with Experimental Particle Physics training background. 

I graduated in 2007 with a major in Physics from the `University of Aveiro, Portugal <http://www.ua.pt>`_. 

| In September 2011 I defended my PhD :download:`thesis <files/thesis_COliveira.pdf>` "Monte Carlo study of electroluminescence in gaseous detectors". My dissertation work consisted of using and extendind the `Garfield ++ <http://garfieldpp.web.cern.ch/garfieldpp/>`_  and `Magboltz <http://consult.cern.ch/writeup/magboltz/>`_ simulation platforms to simulate the electroluminescence produced during electron avalanches in noble gases. Detectors based in this process have application on multiple areas like Medical Imaging , Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) imaging, High Energy Physics and Dark Matter Research. My work was supervised by `Prof. Dr. Joao Veloso <http://www.ua.pt/research/joao_veloso>`_, `Prof. Dr. Antonio Luis Ferreira <http://www.ua.pt/fis/person/10309053>`_ and `Rob Veenhof <http://rjd.home.cern.ch/rjd/>`_.
| During my work as a PhD candidate I also developed algorithms and software (Matlab-based) for single photon counting X- and Gamma-ray imaging (raw data acquisition, time relational data processing and image reconstruction), which have been applied in the fields of Radiography, Computed Tomography and Energy Resolved X-ray Fluorescence Imaging.

| I spent the last 2 months of 2011 in East Timor teaching Physics to Timorese teachers in the scope of a Night Bachelor studies plan to build up the Timorese high school system. It was an AMAZING and extremely rewarding experience!

| In early 2012 I moved to Berkeley, CA, USA and joined the `Lawrence Berkeley National Lab - Physics Division <http://www.physics.lbl.gov/>`_ as a Post-Doctoral Fellow, where I studied xenon additives (e.g. tri-methyl-amine) for improved performance in terms of energy resolution for `Neutrino Less Double Beta Decay <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_beta_decay>`_ searches, and aiming the sensing of `Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakly_interacting_massive_particles>`_ induced nuclear recoils directionality at monolithic massive detectors, specifically `Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_projection_chamber>`_ (`original paper <http://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.2994775>`_). I was lucky enough to have the opportunity of working under direct supervision of the inventor of the TPC himself, `Dr. David Nygren <http://nygrensymposium2014.lbl.gov/about-dave>`_. This work was embedded in the `Neutrino Experiment with a Xenon TPC (NEXT) <http://next.ific.uv.es/next/>`_ international collaboration, of which I was a member between 2010 and 2015.

| Between 2008 and 2014, I also worked in simulation and optimization of Micro-Pattern Gaseous Detectors like Micro-Hole & Strip Plae (MHSP), `Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_electron_multiplier>`_, Thick-MHSP, Thick-GEM and `Micromegas <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroMegas_detector>`_, as a member of the `CERN RD51 Collaboration <http://rd51-public.web.cern.ch/rd51-public/>`_ . I served as co-convenor of `Working Group 4 (Simulations) <http://rd51-public.web.cern.ch/rd51-public/Activities/WG4.html>`_ between 2011 and 2014.

| In 2014 I made a big bet transitioning from the field of Physics to the intersection of Machine Learning and Bioinformatics when joining, first as a Scientist and then as the Director of Data Analytics, the `Biodesix, Inc <http://www.biodesix.com/>`_ Research and Developement Department. Working in the beautifull town of Steamboat Springs, CO, USA, we combined `Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption / Ionization - Time of Flight spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix-assisted_laser_desorption/ionization>`_ with deep learning inspired algorithms to create new blood-based diagnostics for cancer. I contributed for the development of new algorithms (published in peer-reviewed journals) to address the `curse of dimensionality <http://towardsdatascience.com/the-curse-of-dimensionality-50dc6e49aa1e>`_ that strongly conditions the applicability of traditional Machine Learning techniques in the clinical setting. Using such algorithms, we created generalizable and clinically useful cancer diagnostics, some of them with awarded claims in issued patents.

| In late 2018 I joined `Transamerica <http://www.transamerica.com/individual/>`_, a subsidiary of `Aegon <http://www.aegon.com/home/>`_, as a Data Scientist and have been, since then, developing innovative solutions that transform the way business is conducted in the corporation. Some of the Machine Learning methods I have explored are `Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) <http://towardsdatascience.com/recurrent-neural-networks-d4642c9bc7ce>`_ (e.g `Long-Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs) <http://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-rnns-lstms-and-grus-ed62eb584d90>`_) for sequencial decision modeling and automation, `Transformers <http://huggingface.co/transformers/>`_ for Natural Language Processing in the Questions & Answers context, Semi-supervised Learning and `Reinforcement Learning <http://towardsdatascience.com/applications-of-reinforcement-learning-in-real-world-1a94955bcd12>`_.
